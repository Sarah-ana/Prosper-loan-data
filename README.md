## by Okebiorun Sarah


## Dataset
This document explores a dataset containing 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.

## What do I need to install?
This project uses Python 3 and is designed to be completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE. It is highly recommended that you use the Anaconda distribution to install Python, since the distribution includes all necessary Python libraries as well as Jupyter Notebooks. The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:

NumPy
pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I answer below questions:
1. What the Borrower’s interest rate for prosper loan
2. The Borrower’s APR for prosper loan. Every borrower is concerned about the APR, he/she will be charged for the loan.
3. Does the borrower owns house at the time of listing (True & False)
4. What the current type of employment of prosper rating
5. How worthy are the burrowers
6. Within the last 6 months how many borrowers make more frequent inquiries?
7. What is the APR for risky borrowers
8. How can we be sure that high risk borrowers must have higher BankCardUtilizaiton percentage.
9. Is it possible for a borrowers to overspend and hence would need additional funds?
10. Would the size of loan amount between terms be bigger.

# Conclusion
I got great practice in analysing a dataset, using seaborn for visualisations. I'm sure that with some more time, and, of course, some more learning, I could do better. But the purpose of this notebook was to sharpen my skills. So,far there's been a lot of struggles,but with the help of my course at udacity and futher research i was able to show some visualization.
